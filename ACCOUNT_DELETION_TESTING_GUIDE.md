# Account Deletion Feature - Testing Guide

**Feature:** Account Deletion (Google Play Store Compliance)  
**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Testing

---

## Pre-Testing Setup

### 1. Apply Database Migration

**IMPORTANT:** Run the database migration first before testing.

```sql
-- Connect to your Supabase project SQL Editor
-- Copy and paste the contents of:
-- /ecom_app/database_migrations/account_deletion_function.sql

-- Or use Supabase CLI:
supabase db push
```

**Verify Migration:**
```sql
-- Check if functions exist
SELECT routine_name 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name IN ('delete_user_account', 'is_active_vendor');
```

### 2. Environment Variables

**Web Application (.env.local):**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

**Flutter App:**
- Ensure Supabase configuration is set in `main.dart`

### 3. Test Accounts

Create the following test accounts:

**Test Account 1: Regular Customer**
- Email: `test.customer@example.com`
- Has: Orders, addresses, wishlist items
- Purpose: Test standard account deletion

**Test Account 2: Customer Without Orders**
- Email: `test.newuser@example.com`
- Has: No orders, basic profile only
- Purpose: Test deletion with minimal data

**Test Account 3: Vendor Account**
- Email: `test.vendor@example.com`
- Has: Vendor status approved + products
- Purpose: Test vendor blocking

**Test Account 4: Former Vendor**
- Email: `test.formervendor@example.com`
- Has: Vendor status rejected/suspended, no products
- Purpose: Test deletion of non-active vendor

## Database Function Testing

### Test Functions Directly in SQL Editor

**Test is_active_vendor function:**
```sql
-- Test with regular customer
SELECT is_active_vendor('customer_user_id');
-- Expected: false

-- Test with active vendor
SELECT is_active_vendor('vendor_user_id');
-- Expected: true
```

**Test delete_user_account function:**
```sql
-- Test with test account
SELECT delete_user_account('test_user_id');
-- Expected: JSON with success: true
```

---

## Performance Testing

### Deletion Speed
- **Expected Time:** < 3 seconds for standard account
- **Expected Time:** < 5 seconds for account with 100+ orders

**Test:**
1. Create account with large amount of data:
   - 100+ orders
   - 50+ addresses
   - 200+ wishlist items
2. Time the deletion process

---

## Security Testing

### Test Unauthorized Deletion
```bash
# Try to delete another user's account
curl -X POST 'https://[yourdomain.com]/api/account/delete' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer USER_A_TOKEN' \
  -d '{"password": "user_b_password"}'
```

**Expected:** Should fail with unauthorized error

### Test Without Authentication
```bash
# Try without token
curl -X POST 'https://[yourdomain.com]/api/account/delete' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"password": "test_password"}'
```

**Expected:** 401 Unauthorized

---

## Regression Testing

After account deletion, verify other features still work:

1. ‚úÖ New user registration
2. ‚úÖ Order placement by other users
3. ‚úÖ Vendor product creation
4. ‚úÖ Chat system
5. ‚úÖ Loyalty program

---

## Test Data Cleanup

After testing, clean up test accounts:

```sql
-- List test accounts
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email LIKE '%@example.com';

-- Delete test accounts (if needed for re-testing)
SELECT delete_user_account('test_user_id_1');
SELECT delete_user_account('test_user_id_2');
```

---

## Known Issues / Edge Cases

### Handled ‚úÖ
- Vendor account blocking
- No orders to anonymize
- Network failures
- Incorrect password
- Missing confirmations

### To Monitor üîç
- Very large accounts (1000+ orders)
- Concurrent deletion attempts
- Deletion during active order placement

---

## Success Criteria

Account deletion feature is ready for production when:

- ‚úÖ All 7 test scenarios pass
- ‚úÖ Database verification queries return expected results
- ‚úÖ API endpoints respond correctly
- ‚úÖ Security tests pass (unauthorized attempts fail)
- ‚úÖ Privacy policy is updated
- ‚úÖ Play Store documentation is complete
- ‚úÖ No data leaks or orphaned records

---

## Reporting Issues

If any test fails:

1. Document the failure:
   - Scenario number
   - Steps taken
   - Expected vs actual result
   - Screenshots/logs

2. Check logs:
   - **Flutter:** Device logs in Xcode/Android Studio
   - **API:** Supabase logs or server logs
   - **Database:** PostgreSQL error logs

3. Debug queries:
```sql
-- Check for orphaned data
SELECT 'profiles' as table_name, COUNT(*) 
FROM profiles 
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM auth.users)

UNION ALL

SELECT 'orders', COUNT(*) 
FROM orders 
WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM auth.users)
AND customer_name != 'Deleted User';
```
